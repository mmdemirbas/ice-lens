- DuckDB connection fully synchronized for thread safety
- Session cache uses ConcurrentHashMap for safe concurrent access
- Row data loading deferred until display (lazy dataLoader on RowNode)

- Sorting comparators extracted as shared constants in GraphLayoutService

- Duplicate snapshot-to-metadata edges in graph construction
- Unnecessary `!!` on non-null receiver in App.kt
- Check-then-act race condition on session cache lookup
- O(n^2) position-delete ordering replaced with indexed lookup
